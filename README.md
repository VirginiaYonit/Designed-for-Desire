# Designed for Desire

A Cultural and Data-Driven Journey Through Sex Toy Evolution

## Project Overview

This project explores the evolution of sex toys as both consumer products and cultural symbols. Inspired by direct experience in the adult retail sector and informed by data science techniques, the study investigates how preferences have changed over time, across cultures, and within key product categories.

The focus is on three major brands (Beate Uhse, CalExotics, and Sh!) plus one avant-garde player (Bad Dragon), with a comparative lens on usage types, price dynamics, design trends, and historical narratives.

## Objectives (SMART)

- **Specific**: Analyze sex toy market data with a focus on gender, age patterns, and product design.
- **Measurable**: Scraped and categorized over 100 products; integrated external survey data and academic sources.
- **Achievable**: Technologies used include `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `openpyxl`, and `wordcloud`.
- **Relevant**: Merges data analysis with cultural insight to reveal overlooked patterns in consumer behavior and industry evolution.
- **Time-bound**: Covers historical milestones up to 2024, including regulatory changes and emerging trends.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Web scraping**: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`
- **Data manipulation**: `pandas`, `openpyxl`
- **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `wordcloud`
- **Other**: manual classification of product types, external data sources from surveys and journal articles

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Web scraping from product pages and company catalogs (Beate Uhse, CalExotics, Sh!, Bad Dragon)
2. **Data Cleaning & Enrichment**: Manual curation of product features (usage type, materials, target audience)
3. **Data Analysis**: Frequency analysis, price distribution, usage trends, and cross-brand comparison
4. **Cultural & Historical Framing**: Integration of external literature and legal milestones
5. **Visualization**: Boxplots, bar charts, wordclouds, and annotated timelines

## Key Insights

- Internal-use toys dominate bestsellers, but external-use products lead in user satisfaction.
- Vibrators are increasingly preferred over dildos, especially among younger users.
- Rechargeable and silicone-based products are more appreciated over time.
- Cultural narratives (e.g., fantasy, non-phallic design) are driving niche market success.
- Color choices, pricing, and functionality reflect evolving social values.

## Future Directions

- Expand to include dashboards (BI integration)
- Explore aging, disability, and inclusive design as new product segments
- Analyze user-generated reviews for emotional and functional clustering
- Investigate regulation gaps in global sex tech markets (e.g., CE marking, data privacy)
